# Blockchain
Creating Blockchain using Python and Flask Library.

How to run the program : 
  1)First run the python file from command line
  2)Then open any of our favourite browser and in search bar write url(only for local host) : 
            >http://127.0.0.1:5000/get_chain     ==> To get the whole blockchain
            >http://127.0.0.1:5000/mine_block    ==> To mine a block 
            >http://127.0.0.1:5000/validate_chain    ==> To see whether the blockchain is valid or not (whether someone has tampered with                                                            the blockchain or not)
 
 #Flask Labrary is used as a web frame work
 #Can be put on whole network using server (only "host" needed to be changed in program , see flask doc for that)
